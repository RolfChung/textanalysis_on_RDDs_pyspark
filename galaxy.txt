Samsung’s Galaxy S11 is close to release and its supersized battery, upgraded biometrics and class-leading new display look set to make up for a surprisingly strange name change.

It reveals a phone which delivers far more than its name suggests, for significantly less than you might expect. In fact, industry insiders Ice Universe and OnLeaks have stated it will deliver elements which blow both the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 away.
